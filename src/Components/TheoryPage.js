        The aim of this essay is to critically analyze and reflect on the 2017 social experiment called 
“r/place.” Firstly, through the history of the experiment we are able to grasp a basic understanding<br></br>
of its duration and rules. Secondly, I argue that through McLuhan's theory, the internet and canvas
make the perfect medium for this artwork (McLuhan, 1964). Thirdly, through reflection on the<br></br>
common themes seen used by each community that participated, we see the innovation that the
artwork created. Lastly, through the artwork's unique aspects, the artwork pushes the digital arts<br></br>
space forward.
R/place was an April fools joke made by reddit in 2017 that turned into an internet war where<br></br><br></br>
communities battled for space on a canvas. A reddit employee by the name of Josh Wardle created
the subreddit and the idea was simple. Users could place one pixel on a giant canvas every 5<br></br>
minutes. This is a major limitation to an artwork because no individual could fill the entire canvas,
but millions of people in collaboration with one another could. This is where people would form<br></br>
communities in the masses with a similar goal in mind. To collaborate and create an artwork
together. The duration of this experimental artwork was 72 hours. One of the first communities to<br></br>
form was the “Blue Corner”(R/bluecorner, 2017). This community was committed to keeping the
bottom right corner of the canvas blue. However, this was just the start, as more time passed, the<br></br>
more communities joined and different wars started raging on the canvas. Thus this shows
collaboration on a technical level and despite its limitations in the amount of pixel placement it<br></br>
still worked well with collaborative methods.<br></br><br></br>
The internet served as the perfect medium for this artwork. The definition of a medium in the
dictionary defines it as “a means of effecting or conveying something”(Wits University, 2023) and<br></br>
“a mode of communication”(Wits University, 2023) . In R/place the interaction of millions of
people placing pixels on the canvas is a means of communication between the user and the<br></br>
medium. Once these pixels form a smaller art piece on the canvas, the artpiece then communicates
to others which community “owns” a set spot on the canvas. According to McLuhan's idea of a<br></br>
medium, firstly, a medium has to be an extension of ourselves (McLuhan, 1964). The communities
that participated in the internet war were able to convey some sort of message on the canvas. For<br></br>
example, the Dota2 community who created their logo on the canvas alongside other game
communities, or a country’s flag which conveyed where a certain community was from (R/place<br></br>
2017). This way the canvas extended an user's personality and communicated to the world their
origin or what they were interested in. McLuhan also states that a medium must be socio-culturally<br></br>
embedded (McLuhan, 1964). This is true for the internet and r/place. With millions of people from
different parts of the world that had free access to the canvas, each with their own communities<br></br>
and behaviors, this statement stands true to the r/place subreddit.<br></br><br></br>
Furthermore, the participation of the different communities in the three day experiment all had a
common theme to them: the theme of war. Although this is just art and each community speaks of<br></br>
their interest or origin, the individuals themselves all spoke of wars between communities or used
jargon appropriate to the theme of war. This interested me the most and led me to find each<br></br>
community's “HQ” which is where each community collaborated their attacks on other spaces of
the canvas (R/bluecorner, 2017). For example in the “Blue Corner” HQ subreddit, the Blue Corner<br></br>
community were struggling to keep the bottom right corner of the canvas blue and were under
“attack” from the Amongus and QR Code communities (R/bluecorner, 2017). During this battle<br></br>
the “Blue Corner” community posted on their HQ subreddit that they will “hold on until
reinforcements arrive” and “never surrender” (R/bluecorner, 2017). After a whole day they<br></br>
managed to rebuild their blue corner and posted “from the ashes of the fallout we have rebuilt our
blue corner” (R/bluecorner, 2017). These statements imply that they were at war or in a battle with<br></br>
other communities for space on the canvas. This is only one example of a battle in r/place but there
were many more. Therefore, it is clear that on a conceptual level, there is a theme of war within<br></br>
the artwork itself.<br></br><br></br>
Another common theme that I found interesting within r/place was the theme of respect.
Sometimes two different countries would place their flags next to each other. This was not on<br></br>
purpose. However, if one of the countries happened to place too many of their pixels next to or on
top of the other countries flags, they would notice and start a war against that other country or<br></br>
community. Not only this, but more rarely, communities would respect each other's spaces and
sometimes even share it. For example, the Belgium community was creating their flag vertically<br></br>
and the German community was creating theirs horizontally. The flags then created a cross
formation, which meant they overlapped and would have to share space on the canvas. Instead of<br></br>
overruling each other, they simply shared the space and created some different art pieces where
the flags met. These art pieces included a heart that seemed to be repaired, as well as an “RIP”<br></br>
gravestone. These two art pieces indicate a peace and reflection on the war between the two
countries in World War two where Germany invaded Belgium. Therefore, aesthetically and<br></br>
conceptually, these artworks tie to the theme of war.<br></br><br></br>
R/place is more than a visual representation of Internet Culture but it also conveys humanities
values and endeavors. It is a perfect “2D digital pluriverse”, which is “the existence of many worlds<br></br>
somehow interconnected” (Querejazu, 2016). Many doubted the idea of public and open access to
a canvas, and initially it was thought that it would be chaotic. People quickly started creating their<br></br>
relevant communities in order to collaborate on a project. By the end of the three days it is very
clear that public access was not a mistake. It proved that anyone, with collaboration, can create a<br></br>
beautiful art piece that is able to communicate a message. It was never about the individual,
because one pixel means nothing. But with many hands and a bit of time, we were able to see so<br></br>
many great meanings. It is then clear that the artwork conveys more than just visual elements;
technical elements form a major part of the artwork.<br></br><br></br>
Overall, I think this art piece was a great success and is something that I look back fondly of. I was
present during the experiment, however did not participate in any communities. I was a spectator.<br></br>
Every few hours I would open up reddit to see the progress of the canvas and its wars and battles.
Some hours I would find a new community but then the next day they would be wiped out by a<br></br>
larger community. I think that the social experiment has had a large and long lasting impact in the
broader context of internet culture and digital art. The finished artwork includes over 1500<br></br>
different and intertwined visual pieces each with their own story. This reflects the collaborative
nature of online communities. I feel that the experiment has also shifted digital arts as a whole<br></br>
forward due to its innovative approach to collaborative art by each user placing 1 pixel.
In conclusion, r/place was created in 2017 by Josh Wardle as a way for the internet to create a<br></br>
collaborative internet art piece.<br></br><br></br>

        <h2>Art Work Prep</h2>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <iframe className="videos" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_j6_Gk4GZo0?si=TOxRJlEAz_370m-m" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
          The inspiration of my artwork comes from mostly my own experiences in the esports world. Esports refers to the sport of gaming in which individuals compete in video
          game competitions for fame, glory and money. Since the early years of 13 years of age I have been competing in CS:GO tournaments with teams from South Africa and this
          made up majority of my childhood. The brief video above dives into the history of the video game CS:GO's rich easports history and the impact it had on some of the most
          famous players lives. Although this website is all about the latest game news, sometimes its nice to reminisce on the past. Especially when the past has hidden gems everywhere!<br></br><br></br>

          The history behind the Counter:Strike series has a deep routed connection with the internet. With the boom of the internet came the rise of esports with games quickly coming 
          out with multiplayer modes where player could verse each other online. This sparked the competitive spirit that we all know in physical sports now into digital entertainment. 
          The internet also came with new websites being created such as streaming websites where gaming videos or matches were being streamed online for people with a connection to watch.
          Fast forward to modern days and there are millions of viewers online everyday watching gaming content.

        <h3>The idea</h3>
        <p>
          The idea of my artwork is to use the different maps from the game and to showoff some of the most amazing gameplay clips from the tournaments over the years. The user will be able select the map from
          a dropdown menu and then it will display the map with different points of interests which are displayed by golden circles spread around the map. When the user clicks on a circle,
           then it will display a memorable moment from CS:GO history with a heading and a video. <br></br><br></br>

           Looking back at my own life and struggles that comes with getting involved and serious about esports, I feel that I can relate to the current pro players of the game by seeing their own
           histories and backgrounds. I wanted to specifically inlcude some of my favourite players and community favourite players that we can all relate to. This way the artwork feels a bit personal
           to me and others that may have been in my boat a couple years ago. Players stories are mostly available on youtube as free documentaries where they delve into their childhoods and struggles
           to become the players they are today. Here are just a couple of players that I took great inspiration of for this artwork:
        </p>
        <iframe className="videos" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ORCLuPAuWZ0?si=Vz47uBT__o6p3Iqa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <iframe className="videos" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HI--S6TQ4SI?si=3wXZCZyBWS1jFv9b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        
        <p>
        It is players like these whom I can greatly relate to who mostly inspired my artwork where I and others can look back at the golden days where life was all about the game. <br></br><br></br>
        The Artwork itself is simple and is very easy to understand. Since my website is designed for gamers, it is likely that the user that visits would already know about CS:GO and how big the community and esports scene is.
        Once the user has selected a map, each golden point of interest contrasts with the map background. This leads the players eye directly to any of them and the responsive design allows for the users to understand that they must click on one. 
        </p>

        <h3>Technical concern</h3>
        <p>The main technical concern I have with this artwork is about the responsivness in regards of the popup window. As of now on a larger screen width of atleast 1920x1080, the popup window will appear next to the point of interest which is exactly how I wanted it to work.
          However, the issue may come in on smaller devices where there is not much space. A possible solution to this may be to use media queries to move the popup window to a different location on smaller devices. </p>
