Secondly, I argue that through McLuhan's theory, the internet and canvas\r\nmake the perfect medium for this artwork (McLuhan, 1964). Thirdly, through reflection on the<br></br>\r\ncommon themes seen used by each community that participated, we see the innovation that the\r\nartwork created. Lastly, through the artwork's unique aspects, the artwork pushes the digital arts<br></br>\r\nspace forward.\r\nR/place was an April fools joke made by reddit in 2017 that turned into an internet war where<br></br><br></br>\r\ncommunities battled for space on a canvas. A reddit employee by the name of Josh Wardle created\r\nthe subreddit and the idea was simple. Users could place one pixel on a giant canvas every 5<br></br>\r\nminutes. This is a major limitation to an artwork because no individual could fill the entire canvas,\r\nbut millions of people in collaboration with one another could. This is where people would form<br></br>\r\ncommunities in the masses with a similar goal in mind. To collaborate and create an artwork\r\ntogether. The duration of this experimental artwork was 72 hours. One of the first communities to<br></br>\r\nform was the “Blue Corner”(R/bluecorner, 2017). This community was committed to keeping the\r\nbottom right corner of the canvas blue. However, this was just the start, as more time passed, the<br></br>\r\nmore communities joined and different wars started raging on the canvas. Thus this shows\r\ncollaboration on a technical level and despite its limitations in the amount of pixel placement it<br></br>\r\nstill worked well with collaborative methods.<br></br><br></br>\r\nThe internet served as the perfect medium for this artwork. The definition of a medium in the\r\ndictionary defines it as “a means of effecting or conveying something”(Wits University, 2023) and<br></br>\r\n“a mode of communication”(Wits University, 2023) . In R/place the interaction of millions of\r\npeople placing pixels on the canvas is a means of communication between the user and the<br></br>\r\nmedium. Once these pixels form a smaller art piece on the canvas, the artpiece then communicates\r\nto others which community “owns” a set spot on the canvas. According to McLuhan's idea of a<br></br>\r\nmedium, firstly, a medium has to be an extension of ourselves (McLuhan, 1964). The communities\r\nthat participated in the internet war were able to convey some sort of message on the canvas. For<br></br>\r\nexample, the Dota2 community who created their logo on the canvas alongside other game\r\ncommunities, or a country’s flag which conveyed where a certain community was from (R/place<br></br>\r\n2017). This way the canvas extended an user's personality and communicated to the world their\r\norigin or what they were interested in. McLuhan also states that a medium must be socio-culturally<br></br>\r\nembedded (McLuhan, 1964). This is true for the internet and r/place. With millions of people from\r\ndifferent parts of the world that had free access to the canvas, each with their own communities<br></br>\r\nand behaviors, this statement stands true to the r/place subreddit.<br></br><br></br>\r\nFurthermore, the participation of the different communities in the three day experiment all had a\r\ncommon theme to them: the theme of war. Although this is just art and each community speaks of<br></br>\r\ntheir interest or origin, the individuals themselves all spoke of wars between communities or used\r\njargon appropriate to the theme of war. This interested me the most and led me to find each<br></br>\r\ncommunity's “HQ” which is where each community collaborated their attacks on other spaces of\r\nthe canvas (R/bluecorner, 2017). For example in the “Blue Corner” HQ subreddit, the Blue Corner<br></br>\r\ncommunity were struggling to keep the bottom right corner of the canvas blue and were under\r\n“attack” from the Amongus and QR Code communities (R/bluecorner, 2017). During this battle<br></br>\r\nthe “Blue Corner” community posted on their HQ subreddit that they will “hold on until\r\nreinforcements arrive” and “never surrender” (R/bluecorner, 2017). After a whole day they<br></br>\r\nmanaged to rebuild their blue corner and posted “from the ashes of the fallout we have rebuilt our\r\nblue corner” (R/bluecorner, 2017). These statements imply that they were at war or in a battle with<br></br>\r\nother communities for space on the canvas. This is only one example of a battle in r/place but there\r\nwere many more. Therefore, it is clear that on a conceptual level, there is a theme of war within<br></br>\r\nthe artwork itself.<br></br><br></br>\r\nAnother common theme that I found interesting within r/place was the theme of respect.\r\nSometimes two different countries would place their flags next to each other. This was not on<br></br>\r\npurpose. However, if one of the countries happened to place too many of their pixels next to or on\r\ntop of the other countries flags, they would notice and start a war against that other country or<br></br>\r\ncommunity. Not only this, but more rarely, communities would respect each other's spaces and\r\nsometimes even share it. For example, the Belgium community was creating their flag vertically<br></br>\r\nand the German community was creating theirs horizontally. The flags then created a cross\r\nformation, which meant they overlapped and would have to share space on the canvas. Instead of<br></br>\r\noverruling each other, they simply shared the space and created some different art pieces where\r\nthe flags met. These art pieces included a heart that seemed to be repaired, as well as an “RIP”<br></br>\r\ngravestone. These two art pieces indicate a peace and reflection on the war between the two\r\ncountries in World War two where Germany invaded Belgium. Therefore, aesthetically and<br></br>\r\nconceptually, these artworks tie to the theme of war.<br></br><br></br>\r\nR/place is more than a visual representation of Internet Culture but it also conveys humanities\r\nvalues and endeavors. It is a perfect “2D digital pluriverse”, which is “the existence of many worlds<br></br>\r\nsomehow interconnected” (Querejazu, 2016). Many doubted the idea of public and open access to\r\na canvas, and initially it was thought that it would be chaotic. People quickly started creating their<br></br>\r\nrelevant communities in order to collaborate on a project. By the end of the three days it is very\r\nclear that public access was not a mistake. It proved that anyone, with collaboration, can create a<br></br>\r\nbeautiful art piece that is able to communicate a message. It was never about the individual,\r\nbecause one pixel means nothing. But with many hands and a bit of time, we were able to see so<br></br>\r\nmany great meanings. It is then clear that the artwork conveys more than just visual elements;\r\ntechnical elements form a major part of the artwork.<br></br><br></br>\r\nOverall, I think this art piece was a great success and is something that I look back fondly of. I was\r\npresent during the experiment, however did not participate in any communities. I was a spectator.<br></br>\r\nEvery few hours I would open up reddit to see the progress of the canvas and its wars and battles.\r\nSome hours I would find a new community but then the next day they would be wiped out by a<br></br>\r\nlarger community. I think that the social experiment has had a large and long lasting impact in the\r\nbroader context of internet culture and digital art. The finished artwork includes over 1500<br></br>\r\ndifferent and intertwined visual pieces each with their own story. This reflects the collaborative\r\nnature of online communities. I feel that the experiment has also shifted digital arts as a whole<br></br>\r\nforward due to its innovative approach to collaborative art by each user placing 1 pixel.\r\nIn conclusion, r/place was created in 2017 by Josh Wardle as a way for the internet to create a<br></br>\r\ncollaborative internet art piece.<br></br><br></br>\r\nReferencing:\r\n(No date a) R/place.
