Secondly, I argue that through McLuhan's theory, the internet and canvas make the perfect medium for this artwork (McLuhan, 1964). Thirdly, through reflection on the\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"common themes seen used by each community that participated, we see the innovation that the artwork created. Lastly, through the artwork's unique aspects, the artwork pushes the digital arts\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"space forward. R/place was an April fools joke made by reddit in 2017 that turned into an internet war where\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"communities battled for space on a canvas. A reddit employee by the name of Josh Wardle created the subreddit and the idea was simple. Users could place one pixel on a giant canvas every 5\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"minutes. This is a major limitation to an artwork because no individual could fill the entire canvas, but millions of people in collaboration with one another could. This is where people would form\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"communities in the masses with a similar goal in mind. To collaborate and create an artwork together. The duration of this experimental artwork was 72 hours. One of the first communities to\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"form was the \\u201CBlue Corner\\u201D(R/bluecorner, 2017). This community was committed to keeping the bottom right corner of the canvas blue. However, this was just the start, as more time passed, the\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"more communities joined and different wars started raging on the canvas. Thus this shows collaboration on a technical level and despite its limitations in the amount of pixel placement it\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"still worked well with collaborative methods.\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"The internet served as the perfect medium for this artwork. The definition of a medium in the dictionary defines it as \\u201Ca means of effecting or conveying something\\u201D(Wits University, 2023) and\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"\\u201Ca mode of communication\\u201D(Wits University, 2023) . In R/place the interaction of millions of people placing pixels on the canvas is a means of communication between the user and the\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"medium. Once these pixels form a smaller art piece on the canvas, the artpiece then communicates to others which community \\u201Cowns\\u201D a set spot on the canvas. According to McLuhan's idea of a\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"medium, firstly, a medium has to be an extension of ourselves (McLuhan, 1964). The communities that participated in the internet war were able to convey some sort of message on the canvas. For\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"example, the Dota2 community who created their logo on the canvas alongside other game communities, or a country\\u2019s flag which conveyed where a certain community was from (R/place\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"2017). This way the canvas extended an user's personality and communicated to the world their origin or what they were interested in. McLuhan also states that a medium must be socio-culturally\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"embedded (McLuhan, 1964). This is true for the internet and r/place. With millions of people from different parts of the world that had free access to the canvas, each with their own communities\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"and behaviors, this statement stands true to the r/place subreddit.\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"Furthermore, the participation of the different communities in the three day experiment all had a common theme to them: the theme of war. Although this is just art and each community speaks of\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"their interest or origin, the individuals themselves all spoke of wars between communities or used jargon appropriate to the theme of war. This interested me the most and led me to find each\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"community's \\u201CHQ\\u201D which is where each community collaborated their attacks on other spaces of the canvas (R/bluecorner, 2017). For example in the \\u201CBlue Corner\\u201D HQ subreddit, the Blue Corner\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"community were struggling to keep the bottom right corner of the canvas blue and were under \\u201Cattack\\u201D from the Amongus and QR Code communities (R/bluecorner, 2017). During this battle\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"the \\u201CBlue Corner\\u201D community posted on their HQ subreddit that they will \\u201Chold on until reinforcements arrive\\u201D and \\u201Cnever surrender\\u201D (R/bluecorner, 2017). After a whole day they\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"managed to rebuild their blue corner and posted \\u201Cfrom the ashes of the fallout we have rebuilt our blue corner\\u201D (R/bluecorner, 2017). These statements imply that they were at war or in a battle with\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"other communities for space on the canvas. This is only one example of a battle in r/place but there were many more. Therefore, it is clear that on a conceptual level, there is a theme of war within\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"the artwork itself.\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"Another common theme that I found interesting within r/place was the theme of respect. Sometimes two different countries would place their flags next to each other. This was not on\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"purpose. However, if one of the countries happened to place too many of their pixels next to or on top of the other countries flags, they would notice and start a war against that other country or\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"community. Not only this, but more rarely, communities would respect each other's spaces and sometimes even share it. For example, the Belgium community was creating their flag vertically\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"and the German community was creating theirs horizontally. The flags then created a cross formation, which meant they overlapped and would have to share space on the canvas. Instead of\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"overruling each other, they simply shared the space and created some different art pieces where the flags met. These art pieces included a heart that seemed to be repaired, as well as an \\u201CRIP\\u201D\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"gravestone. These two art pieces indicate a peace and reflection on the war between the two countries in World War two where Germany invaded Belgium. Therefore, aesthetically and\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"conceptually, these artworks tie to the theme of war.\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"R/place is more than a visual representation of Internet Culture but it also conveys humanities values and endeavors. It is a perfect \\u201C2D digital pluriverse\\u201D, which is \\u201Cthe existence of many worlds\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"somehow interconnected\\u201D (Querejazu, 2016). Many doubted the idea of public and open access to a canvas, and initially it was thought that it would be chaotic. People quickly started creating their\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"relevant communities in order to collaborate on a project. By the end of the three days it is very clear that public access was not a mistake. It proved that anyone, with collaboration, can create a\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"beautiful art piece that is able to communicate a message. It was never about the individual, because one pixel means nothing. But with many hands and a bit of time, we were able to see so\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"many great meanings. It is then clear that the artwork conveys more than just visual elements; technical elements form a major part of the artwork.\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"Overall, I think this art piece was a great success and is something that I look back fondly of. I was present during the experiment, however did not participate in any communities. I was a spectator.\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"Every few hours I would open up reddit to see the progress of the canvas and its wars and battles. Some hours I would find a new community but then the next day they would be wiped out by a\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"larger community. I think that the social experiment has had a large and long lasting impact in the broader context of internet culture and digital art. The finished artwork includes over 1500\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"different and intertwined visual pieces each with their own story. This reflects the collaborative nature of online communities. I feel that the experiment has also shifted digital arts as a whole\",/*#__PURE__*/_jsx(\"br\",{}),\"forward due to its innovative approach to collaborative art by each user placing 1 pixel.

In terms of technicaly concerns, I do not think that there is anything major.<br></br>\r\n        Due to the simplicity of the ArtWork, there should not be any major issues, however, this is able to change.\r\n\r\n        </p>\r\n      </section>\r\n    </section>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default TheoryPage;\r\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,MAAO,CAAAA,KAAK,KAAM,OAAO,CACzB,MAAO,yBAAyB,CAChC,MAAO,CAAAC,OAAO,KAAM,8BAA8B,CAClD,MAAO,CAAAC,UAAU,KAAM,gCAAgC,QAAAC,GAAA,IAAAC,IAAA,CAAAC,IAAA,IAAAC,KAAA,yBAEvD,KAAM,CAAAC,UAAU,CAAGA,CAAA,GAAM,CACvB,mBACED,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,aAAa,CAAAC,QAAA,eAC9BL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,CAAI,OAAK,CAAI,CAAC,cACdL,IAAA,YAASI,SAAS,CAAC,OAAO,CAAAC,QAAA,cACxBH,KAAA,MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG,gNAEyF,cAAAL,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,mMAEjB,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,iMAEH,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,+GAEd,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,+LAEnB,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,wMAEN,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,gMAEP,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,2MAER,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,8LAET,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,gDAC9D,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,4MAEkC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,kMAElB,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,yMAEN,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,mMAEH,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,0LAEf,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,mMAEF,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,qMAEX,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,sEACtC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,mMAES,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,iMAEZ,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,mNAEL,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,mMAEd,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,iNAEV,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,mNAEC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,yMAEX,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,sBACvF,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,uLAEwD,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,uMAEL,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,8LAEZ,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,2LAET,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,6MAEP,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,qLAEnB,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,wDAC1C,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,uNAE8B,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,4MAER,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,yMAEZ,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,+LAEd,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,sJAEnD,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,2MAE2B,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,gMAEhB,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,mMAEP,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,uMAEJ,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,4LAEX,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,oCACvE,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,klBAW3C,EAAG,CAAC,CACG,CAAC,cACVE,KAAA,YAASE,SAAS,CAAC,aAAa,CAAAC,QAAA,eAC9BL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,CAAI,eAAa,CAAI,CAAC,cACtBL,IAAA,OAAAK,QAAA,CAAI,aAAW,CAAI,CAAC,cACpBL,IAAA,QAAKM,GAAG,CAAET,OAAQ,CAACU,GAAG,CAAC,0BAA0B,CAACH,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,CAAC,CAAC,cACvEF,KAAA,MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG,2KACwK,cAAAL,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,0MACqB,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,wLAC3B,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,wLACT,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,2LACN,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,mMACD,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,wIAE3M,EAAG,CAAC,cACJA,IAAA,QAAKM,GAAG,CAAER,UAAW,CAACS,GAAG,CAAC,4BAA4B,CAACH,SAAS,CAAC,UAAU,CAAC,CAAC,cAC7EJ,IAAA,MAAAK,QAAA,CAAG,8NAAuN,CAAG,CAAC,cAAAL,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,cAChPE,KAAA,MAAAG,QAAA,EAAG,oLAAkL,cAAAL,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,0MACS,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,wMACb,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,4LACnB,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,kMACH,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,gNACK,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,mNACN,cAAAA,IAAA,QAAQ,CAAC,+GAGzN,EAAG,CAAC,EACG,CAAC,EACH,CAAC,CAEd,CAAC,CAED,cAAe,CAAAG,UAAU","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
