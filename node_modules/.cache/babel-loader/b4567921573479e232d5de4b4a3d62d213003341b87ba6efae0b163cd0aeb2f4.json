For example in the “Blue Corner” HQ subreddit, the Blue Corner<br></br>\r\ncommunity were struggling to keep the bottom right corner of the canvas blue and were under\r\n“attack” from the Amongus and QR Code communities (R/bluecorner, 2017). During this battle<br></br>\r\nthe “Blue Corner” community posted on their HQ subreddit that they will “hold on until\r\nreinforcements arrive” and “never surrender” (R/bluecorner, 2017). After a whole day they<br></br>\r\nmanaged to rebuild their blue corner and posted “from the ashes of the fallout we have rebuilt our\r\nblue corner” (R/bluecorner, 2017). These statements imply that they were at war or in a battle with<br></br>\r\nother communities for space on the canvas. This is only one example of a battle in r/place but there\r\nwere many more. Therefore, it is clear that on a conceptual level, there is a theme of war within<br></br>\r\nthe artwork itself.<br></br><br></br>\r\nAnother common theme that I found interesting within r/place was the theme of respect.\r\nSometimes two different countries would place their flags next to each other. This was not on<br></br>\r\npurpose. However, if one of the countries happened to place too many of their pixels next to or on\r\ntop of the other countries flags, they would notice and start a war against that other country or<br></br>\r\ncommunity. Not only this, but more rarely, communities would respect each other's spaces and\r\nsometimes even share it. For example, the Belgium community was creating their flag vertically<br></br>\r\nand the German community was creating theirs horizontally. The flags then created a cross\r\nformation, which meant they overlapped and would have to share space on the canvas. Instead of<br></br>\r\noverruling each other, they simply shared the space and created some different art pieces where\r\nthe flags met. These art pieces included a heart that seemed to be repaired, as well as an “RIP”<br></br>\r\ngravestone. These two art pieces indicate a peace and reflection on the war between the two\r\ncountries in World War two where Germany invaded Belgium. Therefore, aesthetically and<br></br>\r\nconceptually, these artworks tie to the theme of war.<br></br><br></br>\r\nR/place is more than a visual representation of Internet Culture but it also conveys humanities\r\nvalues and endeavors. It is a perfect “2D digital pluriverse”, which is “the existence of many worlds<br></br>\r\nsomehow interconnected” (Querejazu, 2016). Many doubted the idea of public and open access to\r\na canvas, and initially it was thought that it would be chaotic. People quickly started creating their<br></br>\r\nrelevant communities in order to collaborate on a project. By the end of the three days it is very\r\nclear that public access was not a mistake. It proved that anyone, with collaboration, can create a<br></br>\r\nbeautiful art piece that is able to communicate a message. It was never about the individual,\r\nbecause one pixel means nothing. But with many hands and a bit of time, we were able to see so<br></br>\r\nmany great meanings. It is then clear that the artwork conveys more than just visual elements;\r\ntechnical elements form a major part of the artwork.<br></br><br></br>\r\nOverall, I think this art piece was a great success and is something that I look back fondly of. I was\r\npresent during the experiment, however did not participate in any communities. I was a spectator.<br></br>\r\nEvery few hours I would open up reddit to see the progress of the canvas and its wars and battles.\r\nSome hours I would find a new community but then the next day they would be wiped out by a<br></br>\r\nlarger community. I think that the social experiment has had a large and long lasting impact in the\r\nbroader context of internet culture and digital art. The finished artwork includes over 1500<br></br>\r\ndifferent and intertwined visual pieces each with their own story. This reflects the collaborative\r\nnature of online communities. I feel that the experiment has also shifted digital arts as a whole<br></br>\r\nforward due to its innovative approach to collaborative art by each user placing 1 pixel.\r\nIn conclusion, r/place was created in 2017 by Josh Wardle as a way for the internet to create a<br></br>\r\ncollaborative internet art piece.<br></br><br></br>\r\nReferencing:\r\n(No date a) R/place.
